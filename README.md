# AtticRadar

A clean, simple, but powerful weather toolkit for the web browser. Includes NEXRAD parsing and plotting, doppler velocity dealiasing, weather alerts, real time lightning data, METAR station data, and much more.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
Some radar data may be plotted slightly inaccurately on the map, even more so the further away you get from the radar station. This was an issue [recently discovered](https://github.com/SteepAtticStairs/AtticRadar/issues/21) and we are working towards a fix.
<br><br>
üö® **AtticRadar should NEVER be used for life-saving information! ALWAYS go to the NWS or other sources with accurate data and information!!!** üö®
<br><br>
In my mind, AtticRadar is more of a proof-of-concept rather than an app to use in the field.
<br> Some apps with data that is known to be accurate include [radar.weather.gov](https://radar.weather.gov), RadarScope, RadarOmega, [WeatherWise](https://web.weatherwise.app/), and [QuadWeather](https://radar.quadweather.com)

## Approved Source Code Usage
AtticRadar's source code is published here on GitHub for people to explore and see how everything works under the hood. If you're interested in using some of AtticRadar's code in your project, I'd really appreciate it if you reached out to me first. My email is open at `steepatticstairs@gmail.com`, or you can send me a message on Discord at `steepatticstairs` if you'd prefer.

## Website
You can find the app live here:<br>

## Credits
The libraries that parse NEXRAD files client-side were provided by two python packages, which can be found here:
- Level 2 parsing comes from [nexrad_level2.py](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/blob/main/pyart/io/nexrad_level2.py), ported to JavaScript from [pyart](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/)
- Level 3 parsing comes from [nexrad.py](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/main/src/metpy/io/nexrad.py), ported to JavaScript from [MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/)

Inspiration for the app to be created, and some of the code for WebGL rendering, came from [QuadWeather's](https://twitter.com/quadweather) radar app, which can be found here: [https://radar.quadweather.com](https://radar.quadweather.com)

Virtually all of the code for the doppler dealiasing algorithm comes from [pyart](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart). I used their [region-based](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/blob/main/pyart/correct/region_dealias.py) dealiasing algorithm. I go into more depth about the process behind this in the JavaScript dealiasing file in this project.

The Storm-Relative Velocity implementation comes from [@slash2314](https://github.com/slash2314)! Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/SteepAtticStairs/AtticRadar/pull/12) link for more details.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/SteepAtticStairs/AtticRadar.git
cd AtticRadar
npm install
npm run build
php -S 127.0.0.1:3333
```
then you can go to `localhost:3333` or `127.0.0.1:3333` to view the website.

Using PHP as the local server was intentional, because of development that I do of server-side code that affects AtticRadar.

Browserify is used in AtticRadar to implement a moduling system. `npm run build` bundles the project with Browserify to be used in distribution.

You can also run
```
npm run serve
```
to use `watchify` (another project by Browserify) to auto-bundle the project every time you make a change.

## History
* `Jul 13 2022` - On that morning, I stumbled across QuadWeather's radar app, which was still in development, while browsing Twitter. This was the initial inspiration to create AtticRadar (called "NexradJS" at the time).
* `Sep 10 2022` - Renamed this project from "NexradJS" to "AtticRadar"
* `Jun 28 2023` - Updated URL from "steepatticstairs.net/AtticRadar" to "atticradar.steepatticstairs.net"
