    Hello everyone,
    <br><br>
    I'm sorry to say that AtticRadar is shutting down.<br>
    I don't have the same motivation & ideas for this website that I used to.<br>
    Also, a lot of the code would need a complete rewrite to make future development go smoothly.
    <br><br>
    Some might wonder why I have to shut it down instead of just letting the website continue running.<br>
    I was starting to accrue significant charges from my map tiling provider because enough people were using AtticRadar monthly.<br>
    This, coupled with server management and costs, made it a massive headache to manage all these issues on a "legacy" project like this.
    <br><br>
    The source code will remain on <a href="https://github.com/SteepAtticStairs/AtticRadar">GitHub</a> for those interested.
    <br><br>
    Thanks for all the support over the past few years! You all have been awesome to me.
